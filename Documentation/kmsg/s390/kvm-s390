 * Text: "SIE is not available\n"
 * Severity: Informational
 * Description:
 * The Linux instance does not support the Start Interpretive Execution
 * (SIE) instruction. KVM hosts require this instruction.
 * User action:
 * If you need to set up a KVM host, use a Linux instance that supports
 * SIE. The kvm.nested=1 kernel parameter is required for KVM guests
 * that are to act as KVM hosts.

 * Text: "Nested KVM hosts cannot provide huge pages\n"
 * Severity: Informational
 * Description:
 * The kvm.nested=1 kernel parameter is required for KVM guests that are
 * to act as KVM hosts. Such nested KVM hosts cannot provide huge memory
 * pages for their guests.
 * Therefore, the kvm.hpage=1 kernel parameter cannot be used for nested
 * KVM hosts.
 * User action:
 * Do not combine the kernel parameters kvm.nested=1 and kvm.hpage=1.
